## üöÄ Project Architecture & Data Flow

The project adheres to a standard Business Intelligence architectural pattern, designed for data integrity, performance, and scalability.

1.  **Raw Data Ingestion:**
    * E-commerce transaction data (CSV/Excel) is initially stored in the `data/raw` directory.
2.  **Staging Layer (SQL Server):**
    * Python scripts (`python/scripts/02_load_data_to_sql.py`) connect to SQL Server and load the cleaned raw data into the `staging.raw_sales` table.
3.  **ETL Process (SQL Server):**
    * A master ETL script (`sql/etl/00_run_full_etl.sql`) orchestrates the transformation:
        * **Date Dimension (`dw.DimDate`):** Populated with a comprehensive range of dates and attributes.
        * **Customer Dimension (`dw.DimCustomer`):** Populated with unique customer information and calculated attributes like `FirstPurchaseDate`, `LastPurchaseDate`, `TotalOrders`, and `TotalSpent`.
        * **Product Dimension (`dw.DimProduct`):** Populated with unique product details, including a custom `Category` based on description keywords.
        * **Sales Fact Table (`dw.FactSales`):** The central table, linking dimensions via surrogate keys and storing transactional metrics (`Quantity`, `UnitPrice`, `TotalAmount`).
4.  **Business Analysis Views (SQL Server):**
    * Pre-joined and aggregated views (`dw.vw_SalesSummary`, `dw.vw_MonthlySales`, `dw.vw_CustomerAnalysis`, `dw.vw_ProductPerformance`) are created on top of the data warehouse. These views simplify data consumption for Power BI and optimize query performance.
5.  **Power BI Visualization:**
    * Power BI Desktop connects directly to these SQL Server views, building an interactive data model, defining DAX measures, and creating the final dashboards.

## üìà Visual Showcase

Below are key visual outputs from the project, demonstrating the progression from raw data insights to final interactive dashboards.

### 1. Initial Data Exploration

Before beginning transformations, an in-depth data exploration was conducted using Python. This provided critical insights into data quality issues such as missing values, data type inconsistencies, and outlier distributions, which were then addressed in the cleaning phase.

*Visualizations like missing value heatmaps and distribution plots were instrumental in understanding the dataset's characteristics and informing the data cleaning strategy.*

### 2. Executive Overview Dashboard

This dashboard serves as the central hub for leadership, providing a high-level summary of critical business performance indicators.

![Executive Overview Dashboard displaying key KPIs, revenue per quarter, category distribution, and product summary](images/Executive%20Overview%20Dashboard.jpg)
*It presents key metrics such as Total Revenue, Total Products Sold, Total Customers, and Average Order Value, alongside visualizations for revenue trends and top product performance.*

### 3. Customer Analysis Dashboard

Focused on understanding and segmenting the customer base, this dashboard provides insights into customer behavior, acquisition, and engagement.

*Key components include a customer portfolio overview segmented by value, a trend line for customer acquisition, and a detailed list of top customers by revenue.*

### 4. Operational Dashboard

Designed for operational teams, this dashboard offers detailed sales performance metrics by country and product category, aiding in strategic adjustments and identifying areas for improvement.

*Features include a year-over-year revenue comparison by country, identification of low-performing product categories, and a monthly trend analysis of total sales and quantity sold.*

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Set Up and Run the Project

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:
* **Python 3.9+:** Ensure "Add Python to PATH" is selected during installation.
* **SQL Server Express:** Download and install the free version of SQL Server.
* **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):** For managing your SQL Server instance and executing SQL scripts.
* **Power BI Desktop:** Download and install the free data visualization tool.
* **Git:** For cloning the repository.
* **Visual Studio Code:** Recommended for code editing and project management.

### Setup Steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ecommerce-business-intelligence.git](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ecommerce-business-intelligence.git)
    cd ecommerce-business-intelligence
    ```

2.  **Set Up Python Environment & Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # For Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # For Mac/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Download Raw Dataset:**
    * Obtain the `data.csv` file from [Kaggle: E-Commerce Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data) or the `Online Retail.xlsx` file from [UCI Machine Learning Repository: Online Retail](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail).
    * Place the downloaded file into the `data/raw/` directory of your project (e.g., `data/raw/ecommerce_data.csv`).

4.  **Create SQL Server Database & Tables:**
    * Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
    * Execute the script: `sql/schema/01_create_database.sql` to create the `ECommerceAnalytics` database.
    * Execute the script: `sql/schema/02_create_tables.sql` to create the `staging.raw_sales` table and all data warehouse (`dw`) dimension and fact tables.

5.  **Load Raw Data into SQL Server Staging:**
    * With your Python virtual environment activated, run the Python script:
        ```bash
        python python/scripts/02_load_data_to_sql.py
        ```
    * This script will clean the raw data and efficiently load it into the `staging.raw_sales` table.

6.  **Execute the ETL Process:**
    * In SSMS, open and execute the master ETL script: `sql/etl/00_run_full_etl.sql`.
    * This script will orchestrate the full ETL process, populating all `dw` dimension tables (`DimDate`, `DimCustomer`, `DimProduct`), the `FactSales` table, and creating the necessary business analysis views in the `dw` schema.

7.  **Open and Explore Power BI Dashboard:**
    * Open the Power BI Desktop application.
    * Open the `.pbix` file located in the `powerbi/` folder (you'll create this file as you build your Power BI dashboards based on the provided guide).
    * Ensure the data source settings within Power BI are configured to connect to your local SQL Server instance (typically `localhost` or `.\SQLEXPRESS`) using Windows Authentication.
